# Flow

Flow gives names to your Activity's UI states and navigates between them.


## Features

Navigate between UI states. Support the back button easily without confusing your users with surprising results.

Remember the UI state, and its history, across configuration changes and process death.

Manage resources with set-up/tear-down hooks invoked for each UI state. UI states can easily share resources, and they'll be disposed when no longer needed.

Manage all types of UIs-- complex master-detail views, multiple layers, and window-based dialogs are all simple to manage.
